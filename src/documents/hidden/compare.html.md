The high-level query interface in SociaLite is much easier than the programming interfaces in other state-of-the-art graph/data analysis frameworks. This high-level semantics of SociaLite does not incur any performance penalty; the analysis programs in SociaLite are as fast as, or faster than the equivalent programs in other analysis frameworks. Here, we compare SociaLite with other data/graph analysis frameworks in terms of programmability and performance.
